Format: Markdown with Pandoc extensions - 
http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown

.. mention that column names need to be perl identifiers somewhere, else accessor needs setting? - DONE

- in Describing databases, add a sidebar/explanatory block, listing the other valid column_info keys, maybe using pandocs DD/DT syntax?
- after this, add a "try it out" section which has the user write a column_info block for (into) User.pm for created_on, using a datetime field, with default value CURRENT TIMESTAMP


Row::insert:
- now has a retrieve_on_insert key for col infos to name more columns that are filled by the db? pulls these plus pcols? (if not supplied)

####

Did I explain "me." and "relname." yet? (by chapter 5, "fetch ordered posts"?

Ditto: MySQL ansi mode?

Intro: Book is not about learning SQL, will describe each concept we cover, but will not fully cover every available function or method.

Add section on literal SQL, at the moment is in 05/having section.

Make sure examples of SQL show placeholders and lists of values applied to them

Footnotes, glossary or both?

UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEEPT = colnames have to be the same? (Helpers::SetOperations says so) - my 5CD2-02-Foundation-2006-01.pdf seems to say not, >query expression> section 7.13, note 16+ seems to say only if "CORRESPONDING" is specified.. names of cols in resulting content is implementation dependent if 

Recursive queries? Trees? Multi-level joins? Functions?

Mention inflatecolumn::Datetime for Post.pm! Ch3 (see also Ch6)

dbic todo: load_components not documented anywhere? see https://metacpan.org/module/Class::C3::Componentised#load_components-comps- !

dbic modules - website - "officially" endorsed/supported components?

Errata, write small app for storing on dbix-class.org, invlude Schema in book.. other "here's one I made earlier"?

Bounties/contributor list for people finding bugs (confirmed) pre-publish? - signed copy to finder of most bugs/fixes?

Database design = describe issue with user->roles.. post as editor, post as commentor (what is a "comment" and how is it not a Post?) then discover what roles a user has, where to get that data from?

Test markdown output!? templates!? (psuedopod template?)


--
DateTime, timestamps - used in chapter 5, but not used or introduced before that, should be in Chapter 4 where we create a Post object for the first time.. or even in Ch 3?

Ch 6 should assume DateTime cols already introduced.

##
Everywhere - change named metacpan links to notes? eg DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler[^dbicdh]
[dbicdh]: [](http://metacpan.org/module/DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler)

##
Note at the beginning/intro/download section, that examples are based on unix shell scripts.. how to write for Windows?

##
skeletons/03 needs a myblog.sql with User + Post in it.

##
exception_action / error catching?
- maybe in find_or_create which is where we mention it
- or 03 ?
